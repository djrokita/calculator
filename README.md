# calculator
A website with a calculator, that should calculate in the same way like a real one (HTML, CSS, JS).
This project reflects my personal development as a programmer. It was developed in 3 steps - the last one is based on modern JS with OOP paradigm.

For build run:
`npm run build`

For start with dev server run:
`npn start`
